This project includes two interfaces that represent two users, 
allowing them to send a file that can be either encrypted, signed, or both.

The interfaces include explanations at each stage. 
For example, when an encrypted message is sent, it indicates that a message has arrived but the sender is not verified.
Similarly, when an encrypted and signed message is sent, it indicates that a message has arrived and provides information about the sender's identity.
